# DemoQA Automation Project (Playwright)

This repository contains automated UI tests written in **Playwright with TypeScript**  
for the public practice website [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/).

The project is part of my learning journey in **QA Automation** and reflects
both successful implementations and real debugging challenges encountered along the way.

## 🧠 Notes About the Project

- Tests are intentionally written in a **beginner-friendly and explicit style**
  to reflect my learning process.
- Some alternative solutions and commented code are kept to show
  exploration, trial-and-error, and debugging.
- Certain interactions (e.g. State & City selection) use `force: true`
  due to known UI overlays (ads) present on the DemoQA website.
- The focus of the project is **understanding Playwright syntax, locators,
  assertions, and real-world UI issues**, not just passing tests.
